• P8.1 We want to add a button to the tally counter in Section 8.2 that allows an operator to undo an accidental button click. Provide a method 
public void undo()
that simulates such a button. As an added precaution, make sure that the operator cannot click the undo button more often than the count button.

        value=value-1;
